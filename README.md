# Data Engineering Case Study

### Download Data
We will be exploring Lending Clubâ€™s loan origination data from 2007-2018. [Download from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club#)

### Part 1: Data Exploration and Evaluation
*Create an exploratory data analysis project. Load the data and perform any necessary cleaning and aggregations to explore and better understand the dataset. Based on your exploration, please describe your high level findings in a few sentences. Please include two data visualizations and two summary statistics to support these findings.*

### Part 2: Data Pipeline Engineering
*Build a prototype of a production data pipeline that will feed an analysis system (data warehouse) based on this dataset. This system will allow data scientists and data analysts to interactively query and explore the data, and will also be used for machine learning model training and evaluation. Assume that the system will receive periodic updates of this dataset over time, and that these updates will need to be processed in a robust, efficient way. For this section, please:*
- *Create a data model / schema in a database or storage engine of your choice.*
- *Develop code that will persist the dataset into this storage system in a fully automated way.*
- *Include any data validation routines that you think may be necessary.*

*Prioritize simplicity in your data model and processing code. Explain your thought process and document any alternate data models you considered along the way. Finally, wrap up with a discussion of system improvements that could be addressed in the future.*
